	abstract = {This paper explores interaction designs for generative AI interfaces that necessitate human involvement throughout the generation process. We argue that such interfaces can promote cognitive engagement, agency, and thoughtful decision-making. Through a case study in text revision, we present and analyze two interaction techniques: (1) using a predictive-text interaction to type the agent's response to a revision request, and (2) highlighting potential edit opportunities in a document. Our implementations demonstrate how these approaches reveal the landscape of writing possibilities and enable fine-grained control. We discuss implications for human-AI writing partnerships and future interaction design directions.},
