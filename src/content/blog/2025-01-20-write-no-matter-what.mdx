One thing that I appreciate about this book is that it is easy to read and "bite sized." This allowed me to commit to finishing this book even with a busy schedule. 

This book is special to me because it is one of the books that my undergraduate advisor, Ken Arnold, recommended to me when I was struggling with a research project. I had only skimmed it back then, but now that was able to read this book in more depth, I wanted to write this blog post to talk about some of my own takeaways from this book.

The overall premise of the book is that our problems with scholarly writing boils down to problems with our attitude and habit towards it. 

Here are some examples of our problematic attitudes:
- We believe that writing is important, but not as urgent as other matters, so we depriotize it and put it off until deadline.
- We believe that we must always exude competence and appear to "have it all figured out," so we treat writing as a *monument*, a *way to prove our worth*, something that must be *perfect*.

Here are some examples of our problematic habits:
- Our tendency to "clear the deck" first before starting writing (even though the deck will never be cleared).
- Our tendency to not realize that we have different energies throughout the day, and giving writing the "C" energy and everything else "A" energy.
- Our tendency to allow ourselves to be distracted when we should be focused on writing, and only on writing.
- Our tendency to constantly compare ourselves to others who we perceive as "better than me" (even though there will always be people who are "better than you").

If writing is indeed "thinking on paper," then it need not be perfect. Our thinking on head is messy, but writing is a tool that allows us to externalize our thinking, develop it, and polish it. Writing happens in different behavioral activities, such as planning, drafting, reviewing, and revising, but not necessarily in order. Writing also allows us to invite others into our thinking, and contribute to it.
