One thing that I appreciate about this book is that it is easy to read and "bite sized." This allowed me to commit to finishing this book even with a busy schedule. This book is special to me because it is one of the books that my undergraduate advisor, Ken Arnold, recommeneded to me when I was struggling with a resaerch project. I had only skimmed it back then, but now that was able to read this book in more depth, I wanted to write this blog post to talk about some of my own takeaways from this book.
