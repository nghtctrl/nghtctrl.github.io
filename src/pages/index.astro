        Hey there! I am an Interim Software Engineer at SIL Language Technology.
      </p>
      <p>
        I recently completed a B.C.S in Computer Science from Calvin University,
        where I was fortunate to be advised by Ken Arnold.
      </p>
      <p>
        My research interest is in human-AI interaction. I am interested in
        studying how we think using AI; and how AI impacts the way we reflect,
        express ourselves, communicate with others, and learn.
