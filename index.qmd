Hi there! I am a senior undergraduate student studying Computer Science at <a class="link" href="https://calvin.edu">Calvin University</a>. I am advised by <a class="link" href="https://kenarnold.org">Ken Arnold</a>.

My research interest is in human-AI interaction. I design, build, and study intelligent and interactive systems that think _with_ people rather than for them, augmenting human intelligence and creativity with AI.
