Hi there! I am a Software Engineer at <a class="link" href="https://software.sil.org/" target="_blank">SIL Language Technology</a>. 

I recently graduated with a B.C.S. in Computer Science from <a class="link" href="https://calvin.edu/" target="_blank">Calvin University</a>, where I worked with <a class="link" href="https://kenarnold.org/" target="_blank">Ken Arnold</a> on intelligent and interactive writing tools.

My research interest is in human-computer interaction. I design, build, and study AI systems that think _with_ people rather than for them, augmenting human intelligence and creativity.

You can reach me at _myfirstname_\@jihokim.dev
