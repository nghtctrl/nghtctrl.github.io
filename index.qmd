Hi there! I am a junior studying Computer Science at <a class="link" href="https://computing.calvin.edu/academics/bcs">Calvin University</a>. I am currently working as an undergraduate research assistant with <a class="link" href="https://kenarnold.org">Kenneth C. Arnold</a>.

My research interests lie at the intersection of HCI and AI. I design, implement, and evaluate AI-powered systems that augment and empower human capabilities. I am currently researching UI affordances that facilitate human-AI collaboration without allowing AI to overstep human ingenuity and autonomy.
