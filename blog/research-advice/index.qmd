- Choosing topics: timing is crucial; avoid topics that could have been done 6 months earlier.
- Project management: finish each project within 6 months, and always run at least 2 projects in parallel.
- Aim for goal-driven research rather than purely idea-driven.
- When writing papers, start by making a presentation; ensure it convinces three types of reviewers (outsiders, experts, related-field scholars).
- Embrace continuous growth through feedback and self-reflection: absorb othersâ€™ skills, update personal strengths and weaknesses.
- Collaboration: leverage mentors and external collaborators effectively.
