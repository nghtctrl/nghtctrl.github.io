    "text": "Choosing topics: timing is crucial; avoid topics that could have been done 6 months earlier.\nProject management: finish each project within 6 months, and always run at least 2 projects in parallel.\nAim for goal-driven research rather than purely idea-driven.\nWhen writing papers, start by making a presentation; ensure it convinces three types of reviewers (outsiders, experts, related-field scholars).\nEmbrace continuous growth through feedback and self-reflection: absorb others’ skills, update personal strengths and weaknesses.\nCollaboration: leverage mentors and external collaborators effectively.\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"
