Arnold.\nMy research interests lie at the intersection of HCI and AI. I design, implement, and evaluate AI-powered systems that augment and empower human capabilities. I am currently researching UI affordances that facilitate human-AI collaboration without allowing AI to overstep human ingenuity and autonomy.\n[Email]   [Current CV]   [Google Scholar]   [Mastodon]   [LinkedIn]"
