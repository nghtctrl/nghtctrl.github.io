Therefore, we can proceed with calculating the confidence interval:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nn <- 400\np_hat <- 0.84\nalpha <- 0.05\n\nz_star <- qnorm(1 - (alpha / 2))                        # <1>\nstandard_error <- sqrt((p_hat * (1 - p_hat)) / n)\ninterval <- p_hat + c(-1, 1) * z_star * standard_error  # <2>\n\ncat(\"(\", round(interval[1], 4), \", \", round(interval[2], 4), \")\", sep = \"\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n(0.8041, 0.8759)\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n1. Divide alpha by 2 to determine the area for one tail, then subtract it from 1 to obtain the area up to the right tail. Then find the z-score that corresponds to this area using the `qnorm` function.\n2. Multiplying the critical value by `c(-1, 1)` is just a lazy yet convenient way to calculate the lower and upper bounds of the confidence interval simultaneously.\n\n<!-- ```{r}\nn <- 400\np_hat <- 0.84\nconf_level <- 0.95\n\nz_star <- qnorm((conf_level + 1) / 2)                   # <1>\nstandard_error <- sqrt((p_hat * (1 - p_hat)) / n)\ninterval <- p_hat + c(-1, 1) * z_star * standard_error\n\ncat(\"(\", round(interval[1], 4), \", \", round(interval[2], 4), \")\", sep = \"\")\n```\n1. The `qnorm` function takes the area up to the right tail as an argument, so we add 1 to the confidence level and divide it by 2 to get the area up to the right tail. -->\n\n<!-- Here is how to interpret the confidence interval:\n\n> We are not certain whether the true population proportion is within the constructed interval; however, the procedure used to construct the interval has a 95% success rate of capturing the true population proportion. -->\n\n### Determination of Sample Size\n\nTo determine the sample size $n$ required to estimate the population proportion $p$ with a desired margin of error $ME$ and a significance level $\\alpha$, we can use the following formula: $$n = \\lceil\\bigg(\\dfrac{z^*}{ME}\\bigg)^2 \\tilde{p} (1 - \\tilde{p})\\rceil$$ where $z^*$ is chosen such that $P(-z^* < Z < z^*) = 1 - \\alpha$ for a given significance level $\\alpha$ and $\\tilde{p}$ is an estimate of the population proportion $p$ (use $\\tilde{p} = 0.5$ if no estimate is available).\n\n### Hypothesis Testing\n\nTo test the null hypothesis $H_0: p = p_0$ against the alternative hypothesis $H_1: p \\neq p_0$ (or a one-tailed alternative), we use the following test statistic: $$z = \\dfrac{\\hat{p} - p_0}{\\sqrt{\\dfrac{p_0 (1 - p_0)}{n}}}$$ where $n$ is the sample size and $\\hat{p}$ is the sample proportion, provided that the population follows a normal distribution or that the sample size $n$ is sufficiently large so that $n p_0 \\geq 10$ and $n (1 - p_0) \\geq 10$.\n\nThere are two approaches to hypothesis testing: critical value approach and p-value approach.\n\n#### Critical Value Approach\n\nSuppose we test the null hypothesis $H_0: p = 0.8$ against the alternative hypothesis $H_1: p \\neq 0.8$ with a significance level of $\\alpha = 0.05$. Then we can calculate the critical value as follows:\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nalpha <- 0.05\nz_star <- qnorm(1 - (alpha / 2))\nz_star\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 1.959964\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\nWe collect a sample of size $n = 400$ with a sample proportion of $\\hat{p} = 0.84$. Without knowing whether the population follows a normal distribution, we verify that both $np_0 = (400)(0.8) = 320 \\geq 10$ and $n(1 - p_0) = (400)(0.2) = 80 \\geq 10$ are satisfied. Therefore, we can proceed with calculating the test statistic:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nn <- 400\np_hat <- 0.84\np_0 <- 0.8\n\nz <- (p_hat - p_0) / sqrt((p_0 * (1 - p_0)) / n)\nz\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 2\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIf the absolute value of the test statistic $|z|$ is greater than the critical value $z^*$, we reject the null hypothesis. Otherwise, we fail to reject the null hypothesis.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nabs(z) > z_star\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] TRUE\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nTherefore, we reject the null hypothesis.\n\n#### P-Value Approach\n\nSuppose we test the null hypothesis $H_0: p = 0.8$ against the alternative hypothesis $H_1: p \\neq 0.8$ with a significance level of $\\alpha = 0.05$.\n\nWe collect a sample of size $n = 400$ with a sample proportion of $\\hat{p} = 0.84$. Without knowing whether the population follows a normal distribution, we verify that both $np_0 = (400)(0.8) = 320 \\geq 10$ and $n(1 - p_0) = (400)(0.2) = 80 \\geq 10$ are satisfied. Therefore, we can proceed with calculating the test statistic:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nn <- 400\np_hat <- 0.84\np_0 <- 0.8\n\nz <- (p_hat - p_0) / sqrt((p_0 * (1 - p_0)) / n)\nz\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 2\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe p-value is the probability of observing a test statistic as extreme as the one calculated from the collected sample, assuming that the null hypothesis is true. The p-value can be calculated as follows:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\np_value <- 2 * pnorm(-abs(z))\np_value\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 0.04550026\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIf the p-value is less than $\\alpha$, we reject the null hypothesis. Otherwise, we fail to reject the null hypothesis.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nalpha <- 0.05\np_value < alpha\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] TRUE\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nTherefore, we reject the null hypothesis.\n\n## Difference in Proportions\n\n### Confidence Interval\n\nIf the population follows a normal distribution or if the sample sizes $n_1$ and $n_2$ are sufficiently large so that $n_1 \\hat{p}_1 \\geq 10$ and $n_1 (1 - \\hat{p}_1) \\geq 10$ and that $n_2 \\hat{p}_2 \\geq 10$ and $n_2 (1 - \\hat{p}_2) \\geq 10$ for the sample proportions $\\hat{p}_1$ and $\\hat{p}_2$, then a confidence interval for the difference in population proportions $p_1 - p_2$ can be calculated as: $$(\\hat{p}_1 - \\hat{p}_2) \\pm z^* \\sqrt{\\dfrac{\\hat{p}_1 (1 - \\hat{p}_1)}{n_1} + \\dfrac{\\hat{p}_2 (1 - \\hat{p}_2)}{n_2}}$$ where $z^*$ is chosen such that $P(-z^* < Z < z^*) = 1 - \\alpha$ for a given significance level $\\alpha$.\n\n#### Example\n\nSuppose we are given sample sizes of $n_1 = 400$ and $n_2 = 600$, sample proportions of $\\hat{p}_1 = 0.84$ and $\\hat{p}_2 = 0.78$, and a significance level of $\\alpha = 0.05$ (or a $1 - \\alpha = 0.95$ confidence level). \n\nWithout knowing whether the populations follow a normal distribution, we verify that $n_1 \\hat{p}_1 = (400)(0.84) = 336 \\geq 10$, $n_1 (1 - \\hat{p}_1) = (400)(0.16) = 64 \\geq 10$, $n_2 \\hat{p}_2 = (600)(0.78) = 468 \\geq 10$, and $n_2 (1 - \\hat{p}_2) = (600)(0.22) = 132 \\geq 10$ are satisfied.
