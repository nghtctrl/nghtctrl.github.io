## Abstract

This paper explores interaction designs for generative AI interfaces that necessitate human involvement throughout the generation process. We argue that such interfaces can promote cognitive engagement, agency, and thoughtful decision-making. Through a case study in text revision, we present and analyze two interaction techniques: (1) using a predictive-text interaction to type the assistant's response to a revision request, and (2) highlighting potential edit opportunities in a document. Our implementations demonstrate how these approaches reveal the landscape of writing possibilities and enable fine-grained control. We discuss implications for human-AI writing partnerships and future interaction design directions.
