## Vision

We're reimagining how AI can support the writing process while preserving the authenticity of human authorship. Building on our previous work with Textfocals[^1]—an AI writing assistant that offers adaptive feedback through customizable prompts—we're exploring new frontiers in human-AI writing collaboration.

Our research investigates two critical questions at the intersection of AI and writing:

- We're examining the relationship between AI-assisted reflection and direct revision, seeking to understand which approaches best serve writers while maintaining their creative autonomy.
- We're exploring how different interaction modes—particularly speech versus text—affect the depth and quality of the writing reflection process.

This work aims to advance our understanding of how AI can enhance the writing experience while preserving what matters most: the writer's sense of ownership, agency, and authentic creative expression. Our findings will contribute to the broader conversation about designing AI systems that truly serve human needs and creativity.
